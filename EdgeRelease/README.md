The LPC Port of RepRapFirmware requires an additional config file located on the SDCard:/sys/board.txt that contains board pin mappings and other LPC port specific settings. Some sample configs can be found in ExampleBoardConfig. Copy and rename a board config to /sys/board.txt on the SDCard and edit the file to sure all pin mappings etc are correct for your setup.

**The LPC port is experimental - Use at your own risk**
