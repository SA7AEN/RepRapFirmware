RepRapFirmware 3.0beta13 (in preparation)
========================

Recommended compatible firmware:
- Duet Web Control 2.0.4
- DuetWiFiServer 1.23
- DuetSoftwareFramework 1.1.0.5

Feature changes since beta 12:
- Switch-type endstops connected to expansion boards are supported

Bug fixes:
- Stall detection endstops should now work when multiple axes are homed simultaneously

Known issues:
- Duet 3 all revisions: file uploading via the local Ethernet port is unreliable (this is the case in previous firmware versions too). To guard against this, always enable CRC checking in DWC 2.0.4.
- Extruder stall detection (G1 H1 E moves) is not implemented
- Resurrecting a print causes excessive extrusion at the start if the print was sliced using absolute extrusion. Workaround: slice prints using relative extrusion.

RepRapFirmware 3.0beta12
========================
Recommended compatible firmware:
- Duet Web Control 2.0.4
- DuetWiFiServer 1.23
- DuetSoftwareFramework 1.1.0.5

Feature changes since beta 11:
- Duet 3 0.6 and 1.0: pin io8.out is no longer PWM-capable because of a resource clash. If you have connected a BLTouch to IO8, please move it to IO7 and adjust config.g accordingly.
- Duet 3 all revisions: improved the temperature reading accuracy at low temperatures for thermistors connected to the main board (typically it used to read several degrees low)
- Duet 3 all revisions: M308 L and H parameters are supported for thermistors and PT1000 sensors connected to the main board. They should only be used if you have suitable fixed resistors to use for calibration.
- DHT sensors are now supported (thanks wilriker)
- M115 P parameter is now only implemented on those builds that support multiple board types, and only when running config.g at startup
- M500 now accepts optional P10 parameter to force it to save the G10 tool offsets (thanks wilriker). It can be combined with P31 by using M500 P10:31.

Bug fixes:
- Duet 3 0.6 and 1.0: PWM output on io4.out and io5.out now works
- Duet 3 0.6 and 1.0: pin io6.out was incorrectly marked as PWM-capable
- Duet 3 all revisions: Driver 5 on main board didn't generate temperature warnings
- Duet 3 all revisions: updating expansion boards didn't work when running in standalone mode if the USB port was connected to a PC but no terminal emulator was running
- Duet 3 all revisions: the drivers are no longer shut down when VIN exceeds 29V
- In beta 11, control of BLTouch probes was unreliable because of glitches on the control output pin
- Homing sometimes didn't work, especially when endstops switches were already triggered at the start of the homing move
- M308 S# with no other parameters didn't report the sensor details
Known issues:

- Duet 3 all revisions: file uploading via the local Ethernet port is unreliable (this is the case in previous firmware versions too). To guard against this, always enable CRC checking in DWC 2.0.4.
- Extruder stall detection (G1 H1 E moves) is not implemented
- Stall detection endstops don't work properly if you home multiple aes at the same time
